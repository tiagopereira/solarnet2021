There are two ways to work with the materials: download data and necessary packages into your computer (recommended), or online-only using Binder. The Binder option is slower, will timeout when not active, and is meant to be a failsafe option. You can use the Binder version by clicking the link below: Running on your computer \u00b6 If you have already followed the python setup for the SOLARNET school, all packages for the lectures and tutorial should already be installed. You can safely ignore the step below to create a new conda environment. The commands below assume you have a conda installation: miniconda ( miniconda or Anaconda ), and have git installed. The first step is to clone the repository into a directory of your choice. Open a terminal and navigate to your preferred directory, and then clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/tiagopereira/solarnet2021.git solarnet_iris If you don't have git, you can instead download a zip file , but then it will be harder to keep the repository current in case there are updates. You will end up with a directory called solarnet_iris . In the terminal, go to that directory. If have not yet installed the common python packages for the SOLARNET school, you can do it using the provided environment.yml (if you have, skip this step): conda env create -f environment.yml Then you need to activate the environment: conda activate solarnet The last step is to download some data files. Please download the following data files into the directory solarnet_iris/notebooks : iris_l2_20180102_153155_3610108077_SJI_1400_t000.fits.gz iris_l2_20140919_051712_3860608353_SJI_2832_t000.fits.gz iris_l2_20180102_153155_3610108077_raster.tar.gz aia_20140919_060030_1700_image_lev1.fits These downloads are about 350 MB.
